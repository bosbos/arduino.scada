Instrumented html and SVG files can be loaded into the iframe by setting the src attribute.

    <div>
        <!-- place where SCADA displays will get loaded. Does not need an id but that would be
            useful for any navigation functions you wanted to add to the desktop html.
            When loading/loaded, vy-client scripts will make jquery "$" function and vytronics "vy"
            object available in the iframe global scope. Loaded SVG, and any of its included
            widgets can also download external javascript using vy-loadscript(url) function. So,
            say you wanted to share some HMI logic across multiple SVG displays, then simply call
            vy-loadscript(url) in the page script.

            SVG files have instrumentation directives in the "http://www.vytronics.com/hmi"
            namespace to link elements to tags etc. These directives are parsed on load to
            create the real-time dynamics.
